Some utilities to help calculate Pokemon type-coverage

# About
Often my favorite part of any Pokemon game is coming up with a team that has a Super Effective move to combat every type in the game.
This set of utilities should be used to help that endeavor, as well as several other key metrics a Pokemon Trainer might care about

# Planned features
* Use one of the many Pokemon databases available to grab type data
* Check if a pokemon is preferably a Special Attacker or Physical Attacker
* Generate a team from the Database that has "Perfect" type coverage - that is 100% of types covered with a 80+ base attack STAB attack in both Physical and Special attacks.

# Far-flung future
* Flask or Django Front-end
